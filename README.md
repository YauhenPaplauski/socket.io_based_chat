# socket.io_based_chat
chat application with the socket.io-client library  Create a chat application with the socket.io-client library. It’s a socket.io based chat interface. When users open the application, they meet this view. It contains a chat message box where the sent messages are floating right and the received messages are floating left. One row contains the text of the message and also the nickname if it is not the current user. There is an input, where you can set the current user’s nickname. Next to it a text input field and a send button at the end. You must not use any 3rd party framework or library other than the socket.io client. It should work on the latest version of Android. It has to have “brutalist” design. Socket.io server address: http://185.13.90.140:8081/ Socket.io version on the server: 2.2.0 You should listen to event message, and you should trigger the event message also. The example data is { message: ‘Hi’, user: ‘guest0001’ } You should commit your code to GitHub and provide the repository url. Good luck!
